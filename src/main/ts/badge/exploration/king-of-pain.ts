  badgeText: `Pain! Every nerve flares with it. Your body sings with a crystalline agony that is transcendent in its intensity.
But this is not a pain that makes you whimper like a struck animal, it makes you growl with fury at the indignity of it.
It is a lesson, a challenge to be conquered, to remain unbowed and ultimately triumph over it.
But in a moment it is gone though the memory of it lingers, as does the conviction that you were the master of it.`,
  notes: `Located 463 yards SE of the Bastion of Pain marker, on a rock on the shore of the red lake.`,
