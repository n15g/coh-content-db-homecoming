If you listen long enough you can catch snippets of lost conversations.
Street lore says that for those with the ability to filter out the dross, these collected voices tell the secrets of the city.`,
  notes: `Located 66 yards west of the ${zoneLink(SewerNetwork)} transfer point in the Steel Canyon Sector, on the path leading into the sewers.`,
