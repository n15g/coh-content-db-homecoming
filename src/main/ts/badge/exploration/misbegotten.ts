  badgeText: `You're no hero. You're a thug. A super-powered bully who metes out pain and suffering in equal measure.
What kind of person are you, who finds inspiration in the broken bodies and shattered lives you've left in your wake?
What kind of person has their life enhanced every time some "villain" crumples in a lifeless heap at your feet?
Does it make you feel powerful? You're a leech, sucking the life from everyone who stands between you and your "noble goals" for a "better, safer society." Have you no shame?`,
  notes: `Located 250 yards ENE of the Bastion of Shame marker, on the NE edge of the island.`,
