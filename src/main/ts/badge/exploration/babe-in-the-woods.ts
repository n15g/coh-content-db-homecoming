  badgeText: `Hulking spires of stone splinter the landscape all around you, at this, the outermost edge of The Hive.
So this is what a world re-shaped by the Devouring Earth would look likeâ€”a place completely inhospitable to humanity, a land rendered hostile to your very presence.
You overcome a sudden feeling of insignificance as you gaze upon Hamidon's creation.`,
  notes: `Located 144 yards west and a bit north of the Eden transfer point, near the middle of the valley leading into the zone.`,
