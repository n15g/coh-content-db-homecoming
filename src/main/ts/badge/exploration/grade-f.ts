Rumor has it that previously this room was used as part of their indoctrination and training phase. Maybe they still remember it in what's left of their broken minds.`,

The route from the Sector B marker is not direct and the badge is more easily found by travelling 285 yards SE from the Loyalist Surface Access marker.`,
