  badgeText: `It was rumored that in the dim past of the nation's founding, this hill was the site of witch burnings.
Even before Astoria fell to darkness, this hill in Moth Cemetery was well known for feelings of unease it elicited in anyone brave enough to scale its heights.
Since the fall of Astoria, priests of the Banished Pantheon have flocked to this locale, using it as a site for dark rituals.
It was from this vantage point that, for the first time in millennia, the voices of the faithful supplicants was heard by the dreaming God in His violent slumber.`,
  notes: `Located 222 yards SSE of the Moth Cemetery marker, at the top of a steep hill.`,
