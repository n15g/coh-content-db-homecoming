Knox was among the many heroes to give their lives in the Rikti War, but he is best remembered for his efforts to keep Superadine off the streets.
Using his powers of telepathy and divination, it was he who first linked the sale of Superadine to the Family.`,

      monumentText: `This was the site of the first Superadine drug bust. Michael White, otherwise known as the Back Alley Brawler, was patrolling the area when he discovered a pair of thugs haggling over a strange green liquid.
He arrested the villains, confiscated the drug, and brought it to the Freedom Phalanx for analysis.
The Phalanx's top researcher, Dr. Brian Webb, confirmed the Brawler's worst fears: a new drug had been discovered, and its potency was unprecedented.`,

John Knox of the Midnight Squad was the first to observe these grotesque mutations. Afterward, he had this to say, 'I couldn't help but pity them.
In a very real way, these are the people we're working to save.'`,

Little is known about the lab's contents. It is simply known that the Back Alley Brawler and the Statesman swore their comrades to secrecy after the battle.`,

      monumentText: `In late 1982, the Back Alley Brawler and his Regulators were trying to mop up the last traces of Superadine on the city streets.
A tip led them to this building, a front company for the Family. During the raid, Harry Frost, the Family's leader, was accidentally killed, leaving his young son Sebastian to oversee his business.
Since then, Superadine sales have inexplicably increased, despite the best efforts of the Brawler and his comrades.`,
