By tapping into the raw geothermal power of Mount Diable and transforming it into pure electricity, Dr. Aeon has saved the people of the island billions of dollars.
More importantly, large corporations such as Crey Industries can use the incredible power output of the 'PTS' to conduct experiments for the betterment of mankind that would be prohibitive with traditional energy sources.`,

Made to the highest standards of nutrition under quality-controlled industrial conditions, Dr. Aeon's NutriPaste is an inexhaustible and inexpensive food-source for the people of the Rogue Isles.
Flavors such as FishPaste and MeatPaste are a daily staple throughout the Isles, and new varieties are introduced every month.
NutriPaste has even earned its place in the schools of the Isles, where it keeps children fit, happy and healthy.
Thanks to Dr. Aeon's incredible NutriPaste, the next generation of the Rogue Isles will grow up in the most efficient way possible.
Strong and content, they will be ready and able to support Lord Recluse in his never-ending campaign against the oppressive vigilantes who rule the mainland.`,
