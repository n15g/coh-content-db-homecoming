Although the creature and its minions were thought to be vanquished by Paragon City's heroes, it appears they have simply relocated.
The northern village of Salamanca is beset by the creatures and is in grave need of heroic assistance.`,

Since their arrival, the Cabal have taken over the ruins and made them their home. It has been theorized that they feel most at home among these poor ashes.`,

Though she will speak to the occasional hero, her revelations about her reasons for being here are cryptic at best.
Some say she feels an affinity for the Cabal, after having lost her own coven at the hands of Requiem.
Others say her presence here is atonement for some crime she commited during her life.
Whatever her reasons, War Witch is an integral part of the strange mystery that surrounds Croatoa.`,

Various artifacts and tomes stored within the university seem to be valuable to the ghastly creatures that haunt Croatoa, and it is only by the efforts of the magically inclined faculty that these creatures are kept at bay.`,
