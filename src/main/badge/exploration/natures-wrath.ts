    value: `This hill rises like a blister above the canopy that spread like a green plaque to devour Woodvale.
This is a good vantage point to see the devastation the Devouring Earth have wrought.
But it is also strangely calm, an oasis of quiet in a sea of slavering monstrosities.
You are not sure why this hill is so devoid of danger, perhaps it is a true reflection of what the Devouring Earth have to offer.
But such thoughts are borderline insane and likely planted there by some trick of Hamidon's making.`,
