  notes: 'The River Rat Badge has 19 locations in Praetoria, most of which are located under the bridges scattered throughout the zone.'
    + ' In locations not covered by a bridge, look for the life buoys.'
    + ' There are no exact coordinates for these badges; however, they can be approximated by traveling to the locations indicated on the image below.'
    + ' You will not receive the standard "Badge Earned" notification at each location. Instead, open your "Badges" window and select the category, "Closest to Completion".'
    + ' Every time that a waypoint is reached successfully, the badge status will move up the rung towards the top. It is necessary to visit all 19 locations to earn this badge.\n'
    + '\n'
    + 'This badge can be frustrating to get. Where possible, go under bridges in the water; you cannot hit the target location when on the bridge.'
    + ' The two easterly locations in [map:neutropolis] have bridges that are flush to the water surface; the locations are just off to one side of the bridge.\n'
    + '\n'
    + 'It can also matter which zone you are in; the locations on the border between [map:nova-praetoria] and [map:imperial-city] can be approached in either zone.'
    + ' Of these four, the northernmost should be approached while in [map:nova-praetoria]; the others should be approached while in [map:imperial-city], as should those on the'
    + ' [map:imperial-city] - [map:neutropolis] border.\n'
    + '\n'
    + 'It is best to do this badge as soon as you arrive in Praetoria, even if you are very low level.'
    + ' There are no enemies in the water, and the method of watching "Closest to Completion" change only works if you have not unwittingly hit some of the waypoints already.',
