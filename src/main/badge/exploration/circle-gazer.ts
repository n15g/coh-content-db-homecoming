Some say that Dr. Aeon sent a squad of Arachnos to decimate them long ago and though his minions managed to destroy one, spirits haunted Dr. Aeon for weeks.
The operation was inexplicably called off.`,
  notes: `The Circle Gazer Badge is located in the New Haven neighborhood, on top of the easternmost Circle of Thorns monument, 261 yards NNW of the neighborhood marker.`,
