  notes: `Located in [map:${NervaArchipelago.key}], in the Primeva neighborhood.

It is 266 yards north-northwest of the Primeva marker.
 The marker is well-hidden by being near no particular landmark.
 To get to it, go to the jungle below the Primeva marker and head north.
 When you reach a bridge, scale down the cliff and head left (west).
 You will soon come to a pyramid.
 Just past the pyramid, there are two large columns.
 The badge marker is within a fern just past and to the left of the left (southern) column.`,
