  badgeText: `Your life as a hero takes up so much of your time. Hours day and night patrolling the streets of Paragon City, casting down one villain after the next in your quest for glory and influence.
Can nothing else in life command such devotion? The words of loved ones drowned out by the clamor of explosions and blasts of energy, the invitations of friends forgotten the moment a new
crisis arises, competing interests shelved in preference for an assault upon just one more arch-villain's stronghold.
Before you know it life has passed you by and moved on without you. Your loved ones have kindled romances with another.
Your friends have crossed you off of their invite lists. Do you even remember what it was like before you became a hero?`,
  notes: `Located 362 yards WNW from the Bastion of Regret marker, under the floating rock with the circling tablets.`,
