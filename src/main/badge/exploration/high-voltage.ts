    value: `The air crackles with electricity and the odor of ozone fills your nostrils.
Power fills the air here and it draws the Freakshow like moths to a flame.
Juicers and Tanks bellow and cheer as free electrons dance along their synapses, filling them with a battle lust they long to vent upon you.
They challenge you to join them and dance among the volts that skitter across the ground like faerie fire.`,
