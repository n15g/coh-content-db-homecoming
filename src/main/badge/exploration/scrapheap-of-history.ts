    value: `Here lie the ruins of the Number 6 Titration Plant, the first of a new design meant to streamline the process of fuel waste reconstitution.
It was hoped that the new plant design would improve waste recapture efforts by over 13%.
Unfortunately the shiny new installation was too tempting a target for the Freakshow, who saw the effective reuse of fuel waste as somehow offensive.
They brought the plant down with a concentrated assault that took the city workers completely by surprise.
Since its destruction, that new technique the Number 6 plant was designed to test has since been abandoned in favor of a newer, more efficient recapture method.`,
