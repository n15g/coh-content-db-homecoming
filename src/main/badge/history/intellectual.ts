After the Grimm Fairy apprehended the group's ringleader, Ishmael, she discovered that the Lost had kept many citizens imprisoned here for months in order to practice their mental techniques on live subjects. Horrified, the Grimm Fairy appealed for help to the Freedom Phalanx, and Positron dispatched a Task Force to rescue the imprisoned civilians.`,
