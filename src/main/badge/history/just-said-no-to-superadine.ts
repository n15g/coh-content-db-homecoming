Michael White, otherwise known as the Back Alley Brawler, was patrolling the area when he discovered a pair of thugs haggling over a strange green liquid. He arrested the villains, confiscated the drug, and brought it to the Freedom Phalanx for analysis. The Phalanx's top researcher, Dr. Brian Webb, confirmed the Brawler's worst fears: a new drug had been discovered, and its potency was unprecedented.`,

      plaqueInscription: `In late 1982, the Back Alley Brawler and his Regulators were trying to mop up the last traces of Superadine on the city streets. A tip led them to this building, a front company for the Family. During the raid, Harry Frost, the Family's leader, was accidentally killed, leaving his young son Sebastian to oversee his business. Since then, Superadine sales have inexplicably increased, despite the best efforts of the Brawler and his comrades.`,
