    acquisition: `Complete the Troubled Times arc from Dr. Stribbling (Level 30-34, Arc 27.08 in Ouro, Vigilante) multiple times via Ouroboros.`,
	notes: `
 Run the Troubled Times arc from Dr. Stribbling (Level 30-34, Arc 27.08 in Ouro, Vigilante) four times, choosing one of the four fates for Marcus below until all four choices have been made.

* Let him go
* Arrest him
* Return him
* Finish him off

Once each of the above outcomes have been achieved, run the arc a 5th time. Mender Roebuck will appear during the arc, speak to him and during the dialogue, choose to say "I'll do what I believe is best, you have no say in it." Then speak to Marcus, agree to trick his father, and you will have a new mission to take down Dr. Stribbling.
