A Swiss foreigner, the architect found himself in Paragon City by chance, and by some miracle our city had found one of its most gifted artists in turn. Rudolph loved Paragon dearly and dedicated his life's work to uplifting the city in its darkest days.

			Rudolph collaborated with architectural firm Ashburn and Cross to build a new vision of Paragon under the Paragon City Architectural Commision. This partnership was most notably responsible for such incredible sights as Independence Port's Valor Bridge and, most famously, the iconic statue of Atlas dominating the Atlas Park skyline ever since its completion and inauguration in April 1946. This plaque lies outside Hotel Geneva, Seifert's very first project within the city and the beginning of a quiet but deeply impactful legacy. Rudolph Augustus Seifert passed away in 1981, aged 83, survived only by the city he loved so very dearly.`,

			The protest was led first and foremost by the hero Elementar, a founding member of the Freedom Phalanx, who quit the supergroup in order to lead the protest after Statesman and Maiden Justice declared that it would not become involved in politics. With him at the lead, tens of thousands of people - heroes, veterans, office employees, construction workers, students, teachers, and all walks of life - marched in unity against the costs of war and the U.S. involvement.

Anti-communist concerns began to grow in dominance in America, and with it, distrust of one's peers, with fear that anyone could be a secret spy for the Russian military.

			Paragon City was not immune to this - if anything, fear was more pronounced, and concern was turned towards the power imbalance inherent in our heavily powered society. Civilian concerns rose regarding the risks of heroes, and registration laws grew increasingly strict and decreasingly tolerant of those who decided to work around them. The most egregious example of this was the 'hero draft', or the Might for Right act, forcing heroes to work for the CIA, FBI, and Department of Defense in anti-Russian operations. Many of those who refused were locked up within Zigursky Penitentiary, the colossal prison complex that looms above over Brickstown. This theater was later revealed to be a location that protected and hid some of the most vulnerable.

			Here we acknowledge those heroes - many of whom were minority demographics - that were forced into the dangerous and quiet war against the Soviets.`,

In the name of his ecoactivism, Hamidon led an ecoterrorist raid on Paragon City University. On the premises they created a new mutagenic mold - the Will of the Earth. In a cruel twist of fate, Hamidon used the mold on himself in desperation when his raid on an animal testing facility was interrupted by the notorious invisible hero Refactor. There were no survivors amidst the lab's ravaged rooms, and Hamidon escaped justice. The monstrous 'Devouring Earth' showed up weeks later claiming Hamidon as their leader, abducting citizens and heroes in brazen attacks.

			The events that transpired that day marked the beginning of the Rikti threat and the start of the first Rikti Invasion. Lights appeared all over the world, which, four hours later, proved to be portals as legions of Rikti invasion forces came streaming out of them. It was the most horrific and devastating event in the history of the human race, with a death toll of hundreds of thousands in the very first 24 hours. For another six months the Rikti War raged between the heroes of Paragon City, in collaboration with Vanguard, and the alien menace. During that time, entire portions of the city were decimated, with damage costs in the trillions. In an attempt to preserve what remained of our city, the War Walls were built. Of note, a Rikti Mothership crash landed in the area of White Plains, destroying it in an instant and reducing whole neighborhoods to dust in its wake. The shields of the ship remained intact, but the ship remained inert - leading to the decree of the region as a Hazard Zone for further surveillance, research, and potential threat response plans.

			It was only thanks to the selfless sacrifice of the Alpha and Omega Teams that humanity stood a chance, as they mobilized to take down the primary Rikti portal. Though successful, it was not without many sacrifices, including the loss of most of the Omega Team.

			However, it was not over. Again, on July 24, 2007, the Rikti invasion resumed, with aliens streaming out of the ship in White Plains, now dubbed the Rikti War Zone. This invasion was far more targeted at Paragon City. Dropships flew over the city, their bombs plunging to the ground. Shortly afterwards, portals opened and troops streamed out - but this time the heroes of Paragon were prepared. Damage caused by the alien threat has been successfully minimized ever since.

			The Rikti have not given up on their plans, whatever they may be. Continued small-scale attacks are directed at Paragon City to this day, but heroes are always at the ready, prepared to take on the duty of defending our great city.`,

			First sparked by investigating thugs peddling bootleg liquor, the hero Statesman was the one to truly expose the corruption running through the veins of the SUMC. He had discovered that the one leading the operation was none other than the Prussian Prince of Automatons himself, Nemesis.

			It was here in 1932 that this conflict came to a peak, when Nemesis's forces flooded Steel Canyon with troops and weaponry. It was only thanks to Statesman that the villain's forces were finally taken down, solidifying the hero as an icon in Paragon City's eyes and a representative of who we were on a global scale. This would only be the first of many great deeds committed by Paragon City's Greatest Hero.`,

Considered haunted for many years, it was only on March 6, 2012 that we came to understand the true terrors that lurked within. Deep beneath the graves to the north-east of the city zone lay an ancient, horrible evil - a god of death, known simply as Mot.

			On that dark day, the god burst forth from the rotten dirt of the cemetery, a mass of flesh and teeth, extending its reach throughout the area. At once, standard access to the zone was shut down, with only incarnate-level heroes being deemed capable enough to even come close to the behemoth's gaping maw.

			With the aid of the mysterious Dream Doctor, the heroes were able to band together and put an end to Mot once and for all - but the monster's rotting corpse still looms within Dark Astoria, and its forces persist. It is unlikely that that portion of the city will ever truly be safe again. We may only pray that Mot truly is gone.`,

			The Terra Volta complex has undergone many trials and tribulations throughout the years, but has never been truly successfully captured and held by any villainous group. This is not only due to the heroes of Paragon City, but also to the enterprising security personnel of the complex, who are in a constant, thankless arms race to maximize the security of Paragon's most vital non-human resource. This plaque pays homage to their tireless work.`,

            inscription: `April 28, 2004: This date marks the beginning of what has since been referred to as 'The Outbreak Incident'. On this day, the neighborhood of Rivera Heights was placed into immediate and sudden quarantine, following the distribution of an illicit drug containing a powerful mutagen believed to be of Rikti origin. While at first seemingly harmless, the drug caused significant increases in strength amongst those who imbibed it, as well as blind aggression and a lack of regard for one's own life. Identifiable by a powerful green glow in the eyes, individuals ingesting the drug turned Rivera Heights into an outright warzone, requiring Paragon City to call in a multitude of heroes to help round up the villains. The day marked the largest organized effort by heroes since the Rikti invasion two years prior.

			Due to the sheer numbers of infected, Rivera Heights remained in total quarantine past the efforts to suppress the riots, when it was discovered that the effects of the drug were viral in nature and had mutated to become highly transmissible via skin-to-skin contact or bodily fluids. Only a small number of occupants had been allowed to leave, after rigorous testing determined they were clean of the virus. This quarantine lasted for a number of years as cures and vaccines were researched by Vanguard scientists, with the Hazard Doors to Rivera Heights only being opened again to limited civilian entry in 2013. Tragically, most of those infected in the first incident of the Outbreak did not live to see the day.`,
