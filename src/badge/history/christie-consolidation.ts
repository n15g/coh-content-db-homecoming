But in the years after the Rikti War, more than 80 percent of the force was commuting into the area and none of the top brass were local sons and daughters of the community.
As such, the PPD transformed into a rather cold and authoritative force within the Wharf, lacking the ability to truly understand the community they were trying to protect.
Despite efforts to reform, the city nearly caught fire when Kieran Holt died within the walls of the Precinct in 2008.
Emil Christie sought for a peaceful solution, but could not placate the residents who had lived through so much since the Rikti War and riots seemed inevitable.
As a compromise, he contracted with Blackwing Industries, a low-profile corporate paramilitary peacekeeping force, with specific instructions to integrate with the community they were to protect.
Crime is down 46 percent over the last 5 years, and polls show that residents regard Blackwing as a pivotal reason for their peace of mind.`,

The shipping business in Kallisti Wharf may have been collapsing in the 1930s and 40s, but it was being rapidly replaced with industry.
Factories began to pop up across Old Slough, replacing its dairy farms. Seemingly overnight the Slough was building planes, tanks, and weapons, eventually consuming every last bit of the old field, until all that remained was the name.
This area too plunged into poverty during the decline in the 1970s, punctuated by the fire at Manny's Gas Station that took the life of Luigi 'Lou' Spagnolo and sounded a death knell for the community in the area.`,
