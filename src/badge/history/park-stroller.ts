It was during this dark time that many of the city's empty plots and construction yards became cesspools of illicit activity. It wasn't until Brickstown's own Justin Sinclair made it his civic mission to turn these dilapidated lots into verdant recreational parks for all citizens to enjoy. West Park is the landmark first of many parks that has buried the garbage of old Brickstown, and along with it, its crime.`,
