One of the few places to survive the initial bombing, the area became a haven for people with no homes to return to. It also became a coordination nexus for the Vanguard, an umbrella organization designed to coordinate super-powered responses to the Rikti invaders. Though the Vanguard was formed only after the invasion began, it quickly became the only group with any cohesion, as smaller Super Groups were decimated and destroyed. Many of the critical plans for the resistance were relayed through this station, including the fateful Alpha and Omega Gambit.`,

When the Rikti invaders struck, Synapse's first act was to use his super speed to carry as many people out of the area as possible. Though he regretted not being able to join his comrades in battle, he managed to save 87 lives that day before the fire from Rikti plasma weapons tore Woodvale apart.`,
