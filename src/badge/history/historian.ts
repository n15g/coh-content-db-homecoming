Late one night in September of 1999, 6 super-powered mercenaries slipped into this factory complex and made off with several canisters of lethal gas, a byproduct of the factory's machinery. The Freedom Phalanx bested several of the mercenaries, but they were too late to stop one fo the villains from getting away with the gas. Aghast, the city waited and watched. Something bad was about to happen. But nobody knew what.`,

The situation had clearly gotten out of hand, but it was a mercenary activity right here in Paragon City that spurred the creation of the U.N. Special Council of Super Human Activities. In September 1999, super-powered mercenaries stole poisonous gas from a Terra Volta factory. Days later, they struck. They attacked the complex that once rested on this site, gassing the people within. When the Freedom Phalanx investigated, it was discovered that the facility had been a front for an undercover Midnight Squad operation. Several of the Squad's more secretive researchers had been living in this facilty, under the belief that this subterfuge would keep them safe. Forty-seven men and women died in the attack; to this day, no one knows who the perpetrators were.`,
