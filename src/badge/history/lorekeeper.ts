When French soldiers attempted to force them off their land, the Children of Enos bravely attempted to defend themselves. Labeled Cultists by the French soldiers, in the end they were brutally repressed by the notorious witch-hunter Padre Fancois Hardi. Legends claim that the Children of Enos fought for their home and freedom with such ferocity that Padre Hardi believed them possessed by devils. After the last of the Children of Enos were gone, he gave this part of the island it's present name, which means 'The Cape of the Devil' in French.`,

            inscription: `Sharkhead Isle was given its name by the free traders who first mapped and settled it in the early 1600s. For many years it served as a hub for the rest of the Isles, with its naturally protected bay as a home port for explorers, entrepreneurs, and pirates. Sharkhead Isle also acted as a central hub for many of the mystics and witchdoctors of the era, who sought the rare shards of red crystal coral. Even in the modern day, would-be practitioners of magic like the cultists of the Circle of Thorns still attempt to illegally acquire shards of Red Coral Crystal, believing in its supernatural power. This had made it necessary for trade in the Red Crystal to be declared illegal. Any shards of Red Coral Crystal must be turned over to Arachnos to prevent this illegal practice from causing trouble again.`,
